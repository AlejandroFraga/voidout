**Voidout** is an **action** game set in a faraway planet, where darkness, silence, and peace reigned, that is... until they arrived. While carelessly seeking to extract the energy of this planet to harvest and use for their own kin, overlooking the possible consequences.

What they will awake, is far more terrifying, atrocious, or ungodly than anything they have ever faced before. A **dark**, spine-chilling creature with nothing but one goal: to obliterate these forsaken invaders, whilst making everything **succumb to the shadows**.

 * **Embrace the Darkness**: Become a dark creature and face the light by using your unique abilities in order to exterminate the invaders and make light disappear from your planet, restoring it to its former peace.
 * **Straight to the point**: An intense experience, with action from the very beginning.
 * **Appearances can be deceiving**: Don&#x27;t let yourself be fooled by the seemingly innocent enemies; these tiny motherf****** can shoot and will do anything to make light reing in your planet.

### May darkness destroy everthing at the speed of light!
