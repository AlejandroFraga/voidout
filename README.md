# [Voidout](https://loopgang-studios.itch.io/voidout)

Voidout is the Final Master Project we made for the [Master in Video Game Development](http://www.videojuegos-ucm.es/) by the [Complutense University of Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/english).

We are Loopgang Studios. We started as 16 students from the Master, and people from other Masters gave us a hand. They helped us with the music, the animations, the concept art... So, finally, over 30 persons were involved in the development of this project.

We built it from zero using [Unreal Entinge 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/), C++ and Blueprints.

The version control was made with [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com).

The final product (v1.0.0 at 14/07/2020) can be downloaded and played for free on our [itch.io](https://loopgang-studios.itch.io/voidout) webpage.

## Description

![Voidout](https://github.com/AlejandroFraga/voidout/blob/main/images/F5AVl9.png?raw=true)

**Voidout** is an **action** game set in a faraway planet, where darkness, silence, and peace reigned, that is... until they arrived. While carelessly seeking to extract the energy of this planet to harvest and use for their own kin, overlooking the possible consequences.

What they will awake, is far more terrifying, atrocious, or ungodly than anything they have ever faced before. A **dark**, spine-chilling creature with nothing but one goal: to obliterate these forsaken invaders, whilst making everything **succumb to the shadows**.

 * **Embrace the Darkness**: Become a dark creature and face the light by using your unique abilities in order to exterminate the invaders and make light disappear from your planet, restoring it to its former peace.
 * **Straight to the point**: An intense experience, with action from the very beginning.
 * **Appearances can be deceiving**: Don&#x27;t let yourself be fooled by the seemingly innocent enemies; these tiny motherf****** can shoot and will do anything to make light reing in your planet.

### May darkness destroy everthing at the speed of light!
